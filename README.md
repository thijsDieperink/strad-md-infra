## Introduction
Welcome to this strad md infrastructure repository. This repo is focused around development with the brane framework. So, if you want to learn the basics of brane and create your first package and workflow, you have come to the right place. 

The repo is structured so that there is a clear separation between the different sort of tutorials. The folder *'tutorial'* houses all information about the different brane examples/tutorials you can use. If you take a look in this folder, you see a readme which you can go through to start with this part of the repo.
But before you can actually develop with brane, you need to setup a brane system or instance, and to do that, you can go thorugh the *'setup'* folder. Here you can find different setups for different operating systems (OS) and CPU-architectures. Not all scenarios are finished, so if your OS-CPU combination is not supported, let me know and I will add it to the TODO list. If you are not sure about your CPU-architecture, run `uname -m` on mac and linux and `echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE` on windows.
The last folder is called *'configFiles'* and contains some configuration files that need to be run throughout the different instructions in this repo and is not important for now. 

This repository is available on two locations, the PsyData Gitlab page and my own Github page. For those that have access to the UMCU PsyData Gitlab, make sure that you are on the UMCU-INTERN wifi or activate JAMF Trust. For those that don't, you can use my publicly available Github repo. In the documentation throughout this repository, I included the Github URL, but both URLs can be found in the references at the end of this readme. So change this the URL according to your scenario.
